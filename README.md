## ✨ Highlights

- 🏨 **Six marketplace verticals** — Hotels & Stays, Vacation Rentals, Guided Tours, Umrah Packages,
  Verified Guides, and a travel-gear Marketplace, mirroring the website navigation.
- 👤 **Full traveler account** — profile settings, wishlist, hotel bookings, and rental bookings, all
  on a shared `OceanHero` header with expandable, receipt-style booking cards.
- 🏠 **Hosting** — **list, edit, and delete** your own rental properties end-to-end: a full listing
  form (details, amenities, pricing, images) that writes to Supabase, with a confirmation flow.
- 🔐 **Real authentication** — email/password **and** Google OAuth via Supabase, with row-level-security
  scoped data (the same backend the website uses).
- ❤️ **Wishlist** — save any stay, rental, tour, guide, or product with a tap; persisted per user on-device.
- 💳 **Card payments & checkout** — pay by card via **Stripe** (client-side tokenization → a Supabase
  Edge Function charges with the secret key), wired across the hotel, tour, Umrah booking flows and the
  Shop's product checkout (with a Cash-on-Delivery option). See [`docs/PAYMENTS.md`](docs/PAYMENTS.md).
- 🛍️ **The Collection** — a home-style Shop with a navy hero, floating search/sort/filter toolbar and
  category rails; product detail + a complete on-device checkout.
- 🤖 **AI Trip Planner & assistant** — the same `GOT AI` experience as the web, in your pocket.
- 🎨 **"Ocean & Sun" design system** — a cohesive light theme (NativeWind + brand/accent tokens),
  Outfit/Figtree display type, soft gradient heroes (`OceanHero`/`SunCTA`) and full-bleed "featured"
  listing cards shared across every screen, plus spring-based motion throughout. See
  [`docs/Design.md`](docs/Design.md).
- 🧱 **Scalable architecture** — typed, file-based routing and self-contained feature modules that are
  trivial to extend.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app talks to **two backends that mirror the website**:

- **REST API (read-only)** — catalog/content (hotels, rentals, tours, umrah, guides, shop, reviews)
  from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`. Paths live in [`src/api/endpoints.ts`](src/api/endpoints.ts) and flow
  through the Axios client in [`src/api/client.ts`](src/api/client.ts).
- **Supabase (auth + user data)** — sign-in and per-user data (profile, bookings, owned listings)
  via row-level security, using the same project as the web. Client in
  [`src/lib/supabase.ts`](src/lib/supabase.ts). It also hosts the **`create-payment` Edge Function**
  that charges Stripe with the secret key (the `features/payments` module tokenizes the card client-side
  first, so the raw card never touches our servers).

Data always flows **component → React Query hook → `api.ts` → backend** — components never call Axios or
Supabase directly. Each vertical is a self-contained **feature module**:

```
src/features/<vertical>/
├── types.ts        # domain models
├── api.ts          # endpoint / Supabase calls + mappers
├── hooks.ts        # React Query hooks
├── components/     # feature UI
└── index.ts        # public exports
```

`hotels/` is the reference implementation — copy its shape to build a new vertical.

## 🚀 Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node 18+, a package manager, and the [Expo](https://expo.dev) toolchain. iOS builds
require macOS; on Windows use an Android device/emulator or a cloud build (see below).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env      # values are prefilled; the Supabase anon key is public/client-safe

# 3. Start the dev server
npm start                 # then press a (Android), i (iOS), or w (web)
```

> Because the app uses native modules and custom-scheme OAuth, **Google sign-in requires a
> [development build](#-building--releasing-eas)** rather than Expo Go.

### Scripts

| Command             | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `npm start`         | Start the Expo dev server       |
| `npm run android`   | Run on Android emulator/device  |
| `npm run ios`       | Run on iOS simulator (macOS)    |
| `npm run web`       | Run in the browser              |
| `npm run lint`      | Lint with ESLint                |
| `npm run format`    | Format with Prettier            |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check with `tsc --noEmit`  |
| `npm test`          | Run the Jest test suite         |
| `npm run test:watch`| Run Jest in watch mode          |

## 🔑 Environment variables

Only `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` vars are exposed to the client. Define them in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`).
Nothing is hardcoded in source — [`src/config/env.ts`](src/config/env.ts) reads every value from the
environment and **fails loudly** if a required one is missing.

| Variable                        | Required | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------- | :------: | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`           |    ✅    | Base URL of the read-only REST API                       |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_WEB_URL`           |    ✅    | Public website (deep links / web fallbacks)              |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      |    ✅    | Supabase project URL (auth + user data)                  |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` |    ✅    | Supabase anon key — **public/client-safe**, RLS-guarded  |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV`               |    —     | `development` \| `preview` \| `production`               |

> The Supabase anon key is designed to ship in client bundles and is protected by row-level security,
> not by secrecy. Never place server secrets (service-role keys, DB creds) in `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` vars.

## 🔐 Authentication

Email/password works out of the box. **Google OAuth** needs one-time dashboard setup:

1. **Google Cloud** → create OAuth credentials → add redirect
   `https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
2. **Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Google** → enable + paste Client ID/Secret.
3. **Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs** → add `app://auth-callback`.
4. Run it in a **development build** (the `app://` deep link doesn't work in Expo Go).

Path alias `@/*` → `src/*` (and `@/assets/*` → `assets/*`).

## 🏭 Building & releasing (EAS)

Profiles are defined in [`eas.json`](eas.json). Env vars for **bundled** builds (preview/production)
live there too, since those builds compile the JS in the cloud without your local `.env`.

```bash
npm i -g eas-cli
eas login

# Development client (loads JS from your Metro server; needed for Google OAuth)
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Installable release APK (sideload to test)
eas build --profile preview --platform android

# Store-ready production build (.aab for Play Store / .ipa for App Store)
eas build --profile production --platform all
eas submit  --profile production --platform android
```

After a dev build installs, run `npx expo start --dev-client -c` and open it on your device.

## ✅ Quality gates

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # eslint (expo config)
npm test            # jest (jest-expo)
```

`typecheck` and `lint` must pass before a change is considered done; run `npm test` when you
touch anything with unit coverage (e.g. the `auth` schemas/utils).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**Recently shipped:** **Stripe card payments** (tokenize → `create-payment` Edge Function) across the
hotel, tour and Umrah booking flows plus a complete **Shop checkout** (card / Cash-on-Delivery); **The
Collection** shop and a home-style, full-bleed "featured-card" redesign of the Hotels, Guides and Shop
listings (with the Guide/Product details brought to hotel-level depth); and a home-styled **auth** flow.

- [x] Hotel-booking + rental-listing (create / edit / delete) **writes** to Supabase
- [x] Card payments via **Stripe** across booking flows + Shop checkout
- [x] Tours / Umrah / Guides / Shop listing + detail brought to hotel-level depth
- [ ] Persist Shop orders + remaining booking-submission flows to Supabase (some are local stubs today)
- [ ] Review writes to Supabase
- [ ] Native photo upload for listings (currently image URLs)
- [ ] Push notifications for booking status changes
- [ ] Server-backed wishlist sync across devices
- [ ] Screenshot gallery + store listing assets

See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full phased plan and [`docs/DEV_BUILD_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEV_BUILD_GUIDE.md)
for building on a device.

## 🤝 Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for conventions (feature-module pattern, routing, styling) and
the pre-flight checklist. In short: keep API calls in `api.ts`, data in React Query hooks, and styling
in Tailwind `className`s — and make sure `typecheck` + `lint` pass.
